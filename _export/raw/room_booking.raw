====== Room Booking ======
{{ rooms.png?200|}}

The room booking system is based on [[http://mrbs.sourceforge.net/|MRBS]] and is avaliable at http://rooms.newtheatre.org.uk.

Any verified members of this site can log into the system using the same username/password and request room bookings. Certain members of the committee can approve these:

  * Productions Coordinator - for [[archived:in-house]] shows
  * Fringe Coordinator - for [[archived:fringe]] shows
  * Theatre Manager - for all other uses of the room

===== Using on phones / other devices =====
The inital page on the site is today's timetable so that may be of use on a phone without too much tapping.

The bookings can also be subscribed to in a calendar app.
